vi Commands
vi commands are used in "screen" mode (the default),where you use the commands to move around the screen and to per-
from operations on the text.
Most vi commands follow a general pattern:
  [command][number]textobject
or the equivalent form:
  [number][command]textobject
Movement Commands
vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of 
"words."the lowercase commands define a word as a conting-

case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of 
nonwhitespace characters.
